How Function Call works?
All the function calls go to stack and once the function has finished executing,
it's popped out from the stack

Important:
Base condition --> 
   to come out of recursion
   to stop the recursion call to go on indefinitely
   
If we are calling the same function again, each function call would be in
the stack - separate memory for variables and function call.

Why Recursion?
Function calling itself is called Recursion.
And Recursion helps us in solving bigger complex problems in a simpler way
We can convert recursive solutions into iterative solutions and vice versa

Space Complexity --> Not constant because of the function calls in stack. (O(N))
